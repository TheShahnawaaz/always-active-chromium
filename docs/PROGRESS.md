# Progress ledger

Goal: native always-active desktop Chromium with its standard interface unchanged,
ordinary extension support preserved, and verified macOS arm64 and Windows x64
packages. All compilation must run on standard GitHub-hosted runners; no AWS or
other external/self-hosted compute and no additional spending is authorized.

## Confirmed

- Public repository created with user approval.
- Current stable Chrome for Testing version at 2026-11-01T09:13:00Z:
  `156.0.8078.80`, revision `1706539`.
- Chromium release tag `156.0.8078.80` resolves to
  `fb096c0011f9d50f0a264a9376420cdea9c421e3`.
- GitHub-hosted runner preflight run `41348658261` completed successfully.
- macOS runner measured 3 CPUs, 7 GiB RAM and approximately 96 GiB free disk
  before cleanup, with Xcode 26.6 and macOS SDK 26.5. Windows measured 4 CPUs
  and approximately 16 GiB RAM. Corrected preflight run `41349098782` confirmed
  approximately 220 GiB free on Windows D: and 27.7 GiB on C:, Visual Studio
  2026 version 18.11.3 and Windows SDK 26100.
- Official Chromium source archive for the exact version is available and
  measures 4,422,962,028 bytes compressed; a full local Git clone is unnecessary.
- Full source/build outputs are not being downloaded onto the local Mac.
- Extension source and REA evidence from the initial investigation are retained
  locally, outside the public repository. The binary implementation and
  behavioral verification are still pending.
- Native C++/Web IDL patch committed as `74613f1`: 13 exact upstream source
  files, with unchanged browser UI and extension implementation. The applicator
  validates the complete source set before writing. Independent patch dry-run,
  apply/verify/idempotence/reverse, partial recovery and wrong-input rejection
  checks passed. C++ compilation and native runtime behavior are not verified.
- Resumable GitHub-hosted pipeline committed as `8917a4a`. Five checkpoint
  tests passed locally, including exact timestamp preservation, actual Ninja
  no-rebuild restoration and safe exclusion of generated absolute SDK links.
- First real hosted bootstrap run
  [41350730760](https://github.com/TheShahnawaaz/always-active-chromium/actions/runs/41350730760)
  started for both targets. It fetches source/tools, applies the native patch,
  generates GN files and saves a source checkpoint; compilation is deliberately
  deferred until this succeeds. Its result is pending.
- Hosted reference run
  [41350893756](https://github.com/TheShahnawaaz/always-active-chromium/actions/runs/41350893756)
  measures official CFT and the exact shipped extension on both target OSes.
  It uploads finite results only. Local baseline/oracle findings and the later
  environment-wide visibility anomaly are separated in the evidence ledger.

## Work in progress

- First hosted compilation and native behavior verification of the written patch.
- Runtime reference checks on clean hosted Mac and Windows environments.
- Actual source/toolchain/bootstrap results, then resumable compilation.
- Toolchain hydration and resource-aware runner preparation.

## Not yet established

- Whether the constrained hosted runners can finish both full builds with the
  available disk, memory, time and free storage allowances.
- Whether every optional extension behavior has a useful native equivalent.
- Browser binary artifacts, native behavior test results, extension compatibility
  results, signing and distribution results.

Do not mark the goal complete from source changes or successful preflight alone.
